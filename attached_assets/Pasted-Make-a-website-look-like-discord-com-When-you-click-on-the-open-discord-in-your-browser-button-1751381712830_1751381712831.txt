Make a website look like "discord.com" , When you click on the "open discord in your browser" button, you will be taken to the account login and registration section. if the password you registered with matches your name or gmail, redirect to this place. But whoever registers with their name, write that name where it says "AmisMinecraft" and everyone can add different pictures to the picture in the round frame next to that name. Also, in the "Add Friend" section, create a special code for everyone who registers, no one's code will be the same, everyone will be different, for example, write this like "AmisMinecraft#4448" and press the "Send friend request" button so they can send me a friend request and in that request, create a place to accept or reject the friend request instead of all next to the "Add friend" button. Also, after adding a friend, in the "direct messages" section, that friend can talk to the person you added with a private chat. Make the buttons here clickable, add sections for logging in and registering separately. the register location will be like this. Make the login and registration areas clickable, make them clickable and typeable so that you can register and log in. Make the places I marked with red clickable so that I can click and skip tabs, for example, click on the buttons that say "enter your email or phone" and "enter your password" and "Login" and "Register" to open different places. When you click on the button that says "Register", it will be sent to the tab in the second picture. Make the button that says "Register" clickable. Make the button that says "Register" clickable. I can't click it anymore. What don't you understand? Make it artificial intelligence. No, I still can't click the "Register" button. OK. I can click on the "Register" button, but after clicking it, the "E-mail" button can be clicked and even written, but none of the buttons below it can be clicked or written, that is, the "DISPLAY NAME" text cannot be clicked or written, and the place where it says "USERNAME" cannot be clicked or written, and the "PASSWORD" section cannot be clicked or written. Make the 3 tabs under "DATE ​​OF BIRTH" clickable and don't make me say it again. 100% fix and repair, review all codes.
