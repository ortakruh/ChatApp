2025-07-01 15:42:38,970 - semgrep.notifications - WARNING - METRICS: Using configs from the Registry (like --config=p/ci) reports pseudonymous rule metrics to semgrep.dev.
To disable Registry rule metrics, use "--metrics=off".
Using configs only from local files (like --config=xyz.yml) does not enable metrics.

-----
Command failed with output:
fatal: No remote configured to list refs from.


Failed to run 'git ls-remote --get-url'. Possible reasons:

- the git binary is not available
- the current working directory is not a git repository
- the baseline commit is not a parent of the current commit
    (if you are running through semgrep-app, check if you are setting `SEMGREP_BRANCH` or `SEMGREP_BASELINE_COMMIT` properly)
- the current working directory is not marked as safe
    (fix with `git config --global --add safe.directory $(pwd)`)

Try running the command yourself to debug the issue.
